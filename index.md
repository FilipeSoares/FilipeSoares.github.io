# About me

I've been working with software development since 2011 and already worked with some domains implementing solutions to web using languages such as: Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

Nowadays my focus has been design, develop, improve performance and scalability, reuse, quality, devops automation, best practices, code reviewing, refactoring, design patterns, etc.

I believe that motivational factors are diverse and that good work environments provide a creative and productive atmosphere.
