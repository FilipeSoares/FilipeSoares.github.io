## About & Background
I've been working with software development since 2011 and already worked with some domains implementing solutions to web using languages such as: Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

I have worked across web technologies such as: Java, Php, CSS, HMTL. As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of javascript technologies over the years, through jQuery, AngularJS, Angular, NodeJS and most recently to React. 

Nowadays my focus has been design, develop, improve performance and scalability, reuse, quality, devops automation, best practices, code reviewing, refactoring, design patterns, etc.

I believe that motivational factors are diverse and that good work environments provide a creative and productive atmosphere.
